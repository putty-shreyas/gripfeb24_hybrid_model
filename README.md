## Predicting the stock performance based on historical stocks (Numerical) Data and News Headlines Analysis (Textual) Data using a Deep Learning model.
Regression task is performed upon a hybrid mesh of both numerical and textual data using a Multi Layer Perceptron (Deep Neural Network). The task was performed for completing the Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) at The Sparks Foundation and its purpose was to to showcase a merger of NLP and regression techniques in a Python-based Deep Learning project.

## Features 
 - Showcasing step-by-step EDA and Data Wrangling techniques to analyse textual data and merge it with numerical based data for further training.
 - NLP techniques lik Subjecivity, Polarity and Sentiment Intensity Analyzer were performed on the textual data to get respective numerical significant values which was utilized in further training. 
 - Model performance and final results were showcased.

## Results and Summary 
 - Peroformance of Vanilla MLP model on this hybrid mesh of Data was satisfactory but can be significantly improve with more complex models and hyperparameter tuning. (Eg. LSTM, Transformer models with Optuna)
 - Loss graphs show that performance of model training can be improved.
